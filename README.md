# CloudWatcher

CloudWatcher is a thumbnail generation tool for concept artists working for games and/or movies 
specifically focused on creature and character design. The tool allows for a broader frame of reference almost 
like looking at the clouds and spotting various amounts of shapes. The tool is currently being 
developed by a team of three students from the Netherlands called 'Toolbird'.

It is currently only available on Windows, we're looking into porting to MacOS and Linux too. 

# Getting Started

Using the tool is quite trivial, you will see a few sliders, 
which can be modified and will have the effects stated in the labels above them.
You can also make use of the few presets given, to get a head-start on your generation process.
After setting the sliders accordingly, you can press the 'Generate' button to get a random shape.

From here on, you can start rotating the shape by right-clicking within the canvas and following the 
information stated in the context menu. When satisfied with the result, you can press the 'Export' button in the topleft corner of 
the application to export the shape for further modification. Good luck!
