# CloudWatching

CloudWatching is a thumbnail generation tool for concept artists working for games and/or movies 
specifically focused on creature and character design. The tool allows for a broader frame of reference almost 
like looking at the clouds and spotting various amounts of shapes. The tool is currently actively being 
developed by a team of three students from the Netherlands called 'Toolbird'.

From here on, you can start rotating the shape by right-clicking within the canvas and following the 
information stated in the context menu. When satisfied with the result, you can press the 'Export' button in the topleft corner of
