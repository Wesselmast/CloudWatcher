# CloudWatcher

CloudWatcher is a thumbnail generation tool for concept artists working for games and/or movies 
specifically focused on creature and character design. The tool allows for a broader frame of reference almost 
like looking at the clouds and spotting various amounts of shapes. The tool is currently being 
developed by a team of three students from the Netherlands called 'Toolbird'.

It is currently only available on Windows, we're looking into porting to MacOS and Linux too. 

# Getting Started

Using the tool is quite trivial, you will see a few sliders, 
which can be modified and will have the effects stated in the labels above them.
You can also make use of the few presets given, to get a head-start on your generation process.
After setting the sliders accordingly, you can press the 'Generate' button to get a random shape.

From here on, you can start rotating the shape by either right-clicking within the canvas and following the 
information stated in the context menu, or using the shortcuts specified in the top-right hand corner of the application. 
When satisfied with the result, you can either press the 'Export' button in the bottom-left corner of 
the application or use the CTRL + S shortcut to quickly export to a desktop folder which will be created. 
Good luck!
